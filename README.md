# Vim Plugin Profile

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/reorx/vim-plugins-profile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reorx/vim-plugins-profile)

Forked from [hyiltiz/vim-plugins-profile](https://github.com/hyiltiz/vim-plugins-profile),
this repo achieves the goal using only one python script,
and has no ploting skills.


### Supported Plugin-Managers

Here is the list of supported managers. Hopefully, your favourite plugin manager is among the list. If not, or if you prefer to manage your own plguins (using symlinks, of course), we could still adjust the code.

 - [vim-plug]
 - [NeoBundle]
 - [Vundle]
 - [Pathogen]


### Usage

Clone and run `./vim-plugins-profile.py`
